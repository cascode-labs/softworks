# softworks
Softworks supports software and documentation views in Cadence Virtuoso.  This allows Virtuoso users to include these views as part of their design database and open them directly in the appropriate editor.

**I'm in the process of releasing this library publicly, but it should be ready by the last week in August**

Software Views & editors
- Python modules (vs code)
- SKILL & SKILL++ files (SKILL IDE)
- TOML config files (vs code)
- YAML config files (vs code)
- Markdown files (vs code)

Documentation views & editors
- PowerPoint (open office)
- Excel (open office)
- pdf (xpdf)
