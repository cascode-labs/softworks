# softworks
Softworks supports software and documentation views in Cadence Virtuoso.  This allows Virtuoso users to include these views as part of their design database and open them directly in the appropriate editor.  It also creates a user code work area folder with resources for using the tools.

**I'm in the process of releasing this library publicly, but it should be ready by the last week in August**
