SKILL Views
============
SKILL is Virtuoso's built-in scripting language based on the Franz LISP
language.  SKILL and SKILL++ views will open using the SKILL IDE by default.

SKILL IDE
---------
Virtuoso has a built in SKILL IDE which is the default editor for SKILL
views.  However it does take a Cadence SKILL development license and only a
limited number of licenses are available.

Gedit Text Editor
-----------------
`Gedit <https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/>`_ is included as another
editor option.  It is just a text editor and is not as powerful as the SKILL IDE.
However it doesn't require a license.
